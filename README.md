## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
 - Kotlin - Main programming language
 - Firebase Database: For data storage and synchronization across users.
 - Firebase Authentication - For user login and authentication
 - AdMob - Integrated advertisements for revenue generation
 - Hilt (Dagger) - Dependency injection for efficient resource management
 - MVVM Architecture - Using ViewModel and LiveData to manage UI-related data

## üìÇ Detailed Structure
The project is organized into several key packages, each serving a distinct purpose to ensure clean architecture and maintainability.

 - data:

   - datasource:
This package contains classes responsible for data retrieval, serving as the primary interface for accessing data. 
The Repository pattern is implemented here, where each repository abstracts the complexities of data operations. The data source classes provide a seamless way to interact with data, enabling easy integration and testing.
Example files:
DataSource.kt: Manages user network calls and fetches data from APIs. (or Firebase)
GameDataSource.kt: Manages game call and fetches data from firebase database.

 - model:
This package defines data models representing objects such as leagues and teams, using data classes in Kotlin for easy data handling.

 - di (Dependency Injection):
This package configures Hilt for dependency injection, simplifying the management of app-wide components and their lifecycles.
   - Example files:
     - AppModule.kt: Provides singleton instances for core dependencies, such as database and network clients.
       
 - ui:

   - adapter:
Contains RecyclerView adapters responsible for displaying lists of game and ranks, handling user interactions efficiently.
   - Example files:

   - fragment:
Houses fragments that encapsulate the UI components and navigation logic for different screens in the application.

   - viewmodel:
Contains ViewModel classes that manage business logic and provide data to the UI, ensuring a reactive and responsive user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Pattern
The repository pattern centralizes data operations and decouples data sources from the UI layer, enhancing testability and maintainability. By using repositories, the application can easily switch between local and remote data sources, ensuring a consistent and efficient data retrieval process.
